# Requirements:

Fetch user data from the JSONPlaceholder API
when the component mounts.

Display the list of user names and emails in a card/list format.

Add a search bar at the top to filter users by name (case-insensitive).

Show a loading spinner while fetching and an error message if the API fails.

Bonus: Add a dropdown filter to sort users by name (Aâ€“Z / Zâ€“A).

ðŸ‘‰ This tests:

useEffect for fetching data

useState for search input & filtered results

Conditional rendering (loading/error states)

Array methods (filter, sort, map)

Clean component structure & reusability
